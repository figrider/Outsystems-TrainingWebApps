# Outsystems-TrainingWebApps
Outsystems Web Apps developed to increased my knowledge in Outsytems and Service Studio 11.

This repository contains web apps that I (Pedro Cantante) developed with the only purpose of practicing, learning, exploring and experimenting with the Outsystems Service Studio 11.

Each ".oap" file can be downloaded and inspected further in Outsystems Service Studio.

IMPORTANT: This apps are the result of guided training guides that can be found at "https://www.outsystems.com/low-code-training/JourneyView?GUID=160a375d-789e-45af-abd8-1365f3b814a2".

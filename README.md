# Outsystems-TrainingWebApps
Outsystems Web Apps developed to increased my knowledge in Outsytems and Service Studio 11.

This repository contains web apps that I (Pedro Cantante) developed with the only purpose of practicing, learning, exploring and experimenting with the Outsystems Service Studio 11.

IMPORTANT: This apps are the result of guided training guides that can be found at "https://www.outsystems.com/low-code-training/JourneyView?GUID=160a375d-789e-45af-abd8-1365f3b814a2".
